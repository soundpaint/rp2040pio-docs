RP2040 PIO Emulator
===================

In late January of 2021, the `Raspberry Pi Foundation
<https://www.raspberrypi.org/>`_ announced their new `Raspberry Pi
Pico <https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/>`_
microcontroller board, based on the new `RP2040 chip
<https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf>`_,
that the foundation designed by itself.

Besides two dual-core Arm Cortex-M0+ processor core, the RP2040 chip
also features two *programmable I/O blocks* (*PIO*) that are highly
interesting components, each including 4 so-called *state machines*
(*SM*).  These state machines are, effectively, extremely simple, but
fast microprocessors that run in parallel and are specialized for bit
processing for the microcontroller's GPIO pins.  The concept of
*side-sets* provides for even more parallelism of bit manipulations.
Typical applications of PIO programs are implementation of I/O
protocols such as, for example, IÂ²C, SPI or WS2812.

In general, writing PIO programs is extremely hard due to its very
special set of bit-manipulation oriented instruction set and parallel
side-effects.  Even worse, there is no way to debug a PIO program on a
real RP2040 chip.  That is, the only way to debug a PIO program is to
emulate a state machine's behaviour and its interaction with the outer
parts of its world.  This is exactly, what the RP2040 PIO emulator
does: It tries to mimick the behaviour of all of the two PIO's state
machines as precise as necessary to reproduce its logical
functionality such that a PIO program can be debugged in the emulator,
thus making developing programs for the PIO much easier.
